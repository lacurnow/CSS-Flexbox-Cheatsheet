            <h2>What is flexbox?</h2> 
                <p>CSS Flexbox is a layout module that permits responsive, dynamic and flexible arrangement of elements without using float 
                or positioning. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How does flexbox work?</h2>
                <p>To arrange elements using flexbox, elements are contained in a 'flex container'. The child elements within are called 
                    'flex items', and these flex items are placed  along 'flex lines'.
                    Lines and items can be manipulated in layout, size and spacing and more along the x and y axes using operators. 
                    Elements can then arrange themselves automically in a responsive manner ('flexing'), allowing optimal utilisation of space.
                    Operators in the flexbox module can act upon the parent container or its children.
                </p>

            <h2>When to use Flexbox</h2>
            <p>Flexbox is not recommended for building whole webpages (larger layouts may instead use Grid), but it is appropriate for
            small-scale layouts and applications e.g. nav menus, web forms. Fox example, the image below may be more useful represented 
        alongside the first table; while this is tricky to do with float positioning, flexbox should make this a breeze.</p>
